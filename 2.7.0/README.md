# Background Service Plugin for Phonegap #

A plugin (and framework code) that allows the development and operation of an Android Background Service.

The example MyService Background Service will write a Hello message to the LogCat every minute.  The MyService is designed as sample code.

## Adding the plugin to your project ##

* libs\backgroundserviceplugin-2.7.0.jar
* src\com\yournamespace\yourappname\MyService.java
* assets\www\backgroundService-2.7.0.js
* assets\www\myService-2.7.0.js
* assets\www\index-2.7.0.html

Add the following to res\xml\config.xml

```
<plugin name="BackgroundServicePlugin" value="com.red_folder.phonegap.plugin.backgroundservice.BackgroundServicePlugin"/>
```

Add the following to AndroidManifest.xml

```
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED" />

<!-- To be added within Application nde -->
<service android:name="com.yournamespace.yourappname.MyService">
	<intent-filter>         
		<action android:name="com.yournamespace.yourappname.MyService"/> 
	</intent-filter>     
</service>

<receiver android:name="com.red_folder.phonegap.plugin.backgroundservice.BootReceiver">

## Spread the love ##

If you find the Background Service Plugin useful then spread the love.

All the work I do on the Plugin is done in my spare time - time I would otherwise be spending taking my wife out for a nice meal or helping my lad find vinyl records (he's currently very much into The Smiths, Fleetwood Mac and Kate Bush).

The Plugin is free and will always remain free.  I will continue to develop, maintain and distribute the Plugin under the MIT License.
